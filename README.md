# ReadySET-GFM

Ready-to-use Software Engineering Templates in GFM format, ready to use in a [Github Wiki](https://github.com/bike-bill/readyset-gfm/wiki).

## About

This is a conversion of the [Tigris.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20200701142616/http://tigris.org/) distribution of the ReadySET Software Engineering Templates into GitHub Flavored Markdown format.

The original ReadySET project is located [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200701142616/http://readyset.tigris.org/). There has been no visible development on the original project since [version 0.9.3](https://web.archive.org/web/20200701142616/http://readyset.tigris.org/docs/release-notes-0-9-3.html) in 2004, but I find it useful, especially in markdown format.

The original Tigris HTML templates are located [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200701142616/http://readyset.tigris.org/nonav/templates/frameset.html). There are also a clones of the original html files on Github at [@brianbaquiran/readyset](https://github.com/brianbaquiran/readyset), [@JNRowe/readyset](https://github.com/JNRowe/readyset), and [@alejo8591/ReadySET](https://github.com/alejo8591/ReadySET).
