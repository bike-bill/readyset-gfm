# ReadySET-GFM
Ready-to-use Software Engineering Templates in GFM format, ready to use in a Github Wiki.

## About
This is a conversion of the [Tigris.org](http://www.tigris.org/) distribution of the ReadySET Software Engineering Templates into GitHub Flavored Markdown format. 

The original ReadySET project is located [here](http://readyset.tigris.org/).  There has been no visible development on the original project since [version 0.9.3](http://readyset.tigris.org/docs/release-notes-0-9-3.html) in 2004, but I find it useful, especially in Strapdown/markdown format. There is a GitHub mirror of the HTML formatted templates at [@brianbaquiran/readyset](https://github.com/brianbaquiran/readyset). 

The original Tigris HTML templates are located [here](http://readyset.tigris.org/nonav/templates/frameset.html).

## Where can I see the GFM templates?
You can see the GFM templates in the [wiki](https://github.com/bike-bill/readyset-gfm/wiki).
